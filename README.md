#### INTRODUCTION
The business problem at hand is the need to provide homeowners with accurate and reliable advice regarding home renovations and their potential impact on the estimated value of their homes. The stakeholder aims to assist homeowners in making informed decisions about renovating their properties, enabling them to maximize their investment returns while improving their living spaces.

To address this problem effectively, the stakeholder must gather relevant data and insights, analyze the factors that influence home value, and develop a comprehensive advisory framework. This framework should consider various renovation projects, their costs, and their potential impact on the estimated value of homes.



## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The stakeholder has a critical business issue to solve: how to give homeowners reliable, individualized recommendations about house improvements and how such changes can affect the assessed worth of their properties. Currently, homeowners are unable to rely on trustworthy information about the extent to which and how much a certain restoration project will raise their property value. Due to this knowledge gap, homeowners are unable to make informed judgments regarding their renovation spending, which creates uncertainty and may result in missed opportunities. The idea is to create a solution that makes use of data-driven insights and industry knowledge to provide thorough guidance to homeowners, aiding them to understand the potential value increase associated with various remodeling options and make decisions that are in line with their objectives and financial considerations.

## MAIN OBJECTIVE
To give homeowners specific and reliable information on how and by how much home improvements can raise the projected value of their houses. This goal strives to arm homeowners with the knowledge they need to choose renovation projects that maximize return on investment while raising the value of their homes.


## SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
- To identify how to develop strategies that enhance the model's predictive power, considering additional predictor variables that may impact house prices, such as location-related factors or specific property features.

-To assess properties with high market value.This can involve conducting thorough inspections and evaluations, considering factors like maintenance history, upgrades, and overall quality.
As well as leveraging geospatial data or collaborating with real estate agents specializing in waterfront properties.

-To evaluate the market trends and buyer preferences.Regularly monitor market trends, including changes in buyer preferences and demands, to adapt pricing strategies accordingly.

## DATA UNDERSTANDING
This project will utilize datasets that consist details regarding a house such as:view, condition, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,whether a house a lot and a basement.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, explorative data analysis techniques will be employed.These techniques involve addressing missing values,veryfing data types,converting datatypes to those suitable ones for creating a model.

## METHODOLOGY
In this project, data analysis and visualization techniques in Python, utilizing libraries such as pandas and matplotlib,will be employed.

The available dataset will be examined through analysis and visualizations.This process will help identify key relationships and trends, enabling the extraction of insights related to house-sales prediction



## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
In this project, data visualizations were used to explore this data and aid in coming up with models that played a role in coming up with recommendations.


## MODELING

We used Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression as the modeling technique to analyze the relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable (house prices). OLS is a widely used and fundamental method for linear regression analysis.

1. Linearity: OLS assumes a linear relationship between the predictor variables and the target variable.We aimed to understand how changes in the predictor variables, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and other features, affect the house prices. OLS is suitable for modeling linear relationships and estimating the coefficients that quantify the impact of these predictors.

2. Ease of Interpretation: OLS provides estimates for the coefficients of the predictor variables, which represent the average change in the target variable associated with a one-unit change in the predictor while holding other predictors constant. This allows for straightforward interpretation and understanding of the relationship between the predictors and the target variable.

3. Statistical Inference: OLS provides standard errors for the coefficient estimates, which allow us to assess the statistical significance of the predictors. By examining the p-values associated with each coefficient, we can determine whether the predictors have a significant impact on house prices.

4. Efficiency: OLS estimates the coefficients that minimize the sum of squared residuals, making it an efficient method for estimating the model parameters. It provides the "best linear unbiased estimates" when the assumptions of OLS are met.

## DATA VISUALIZATIONS
A visualization of the model's results will be plotted so as to ensure a better understanding of the predictive analysis.A scatter plot of the target variable, a histogram of the residuals and a barplot of the coefficients. 


## CONCLUSIONS
1.The model has a statistically significant relationship with the target variable (price), as indicated by the overall model's F-statistic and individual predictor variable p-values.

2.The model explains approximately 66.5% of the variance in the target variable (R-squared value), suggesting that the selected predictor variables collectively have a moderate level of predictive power for determining house prices.

3.The coefficients of the predictor variables provide insights into their individual impacts on house prices. Some variables, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage of living space, show expected relationships with the price, while others, such as the presence of a waterfront view or the property's condition and grade, have unique impacts on the price.



## RECOMMENDATIONS
1.Consider the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage of living space as key factors when determining house prices. Properties with more bedrooms and bathrooms, as well as larger living spaces, tend to command higher prices.

2.Pay attention to the presence of a waterfront view, as it significantly affects house prices. Properties with waterfront views tend to have higher values, indicating their desirability and potential for premium pricing.

3.Evaluate the condition and grade of the property. Both factors can influence the price, with better-conditioned properties and higher-grade ratings generally correlating with higher prices. Ensuring that properties are well-maintained and upgraded to higher-grade levels may lead to increased market value.
